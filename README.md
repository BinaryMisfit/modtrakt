ModTrakt is a WPF based .Net Core 3.1 mod manager for Bethesda games. Most mod managers are focussed on downloading and
installing mod files and enabling these mods. These managers are excellent at what they do.

### So why another mod manager?

When you start running mod load orders bigger then 100+ mods with numerous files overwriting one another within Bethesda
games keeping track or managing these mod files can become cumbersome. The purpose of ModTrakt is to enable some
additional built-in functionality to help advanced mod players apply years of experience to the game.

### How is ModTrakt different?

Apart from downloading, installing and managing mod files, ModTrakt can also:
* Provide all functionality based on sets of rules
* Extract BA2 archives
* Merge loose files
* Merge ESP files
* Supports external tools
    * xEdit
    * LOOT
    * zEdit
    * zMerge
  
### When will ModTrakt be ready for release?
